# Random IBAN, UUID & Date Converter

A simple static website that generates random International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) and Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs), validates IBANs, formats JSON, and converts dates between different formats.

## Features

- Integrated tabbed interface for IBAN generation and validation
- Generate random IBANs for 27 European countries
- Validate IBANs with detailed format and checksum verification
- Easy switching between generating and validating IBANs
- Generate UUIDs in version 4 (random) or version 1 (time-based) format
- Format and minify JSON with syntax highlighting
- Convert dates between multiple formats (ISO, US, EU, Unix timestamp, etc.)
- Copy generated IBANs, UUIDs, formatted JSON, and converted dates to clipboard with a single click
- Select the country for which to generate an IBAN
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Dark mode support for comfortable usage in low-light environments

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser

     - Click "Validate this IBAN" to quickly switch to the validator with the IBAN pre-filled
   - Validator tab:
     - Enter an IBAN in the validation input field
     - Click the "Validate" button or press Enter
     - View the validation result and detailed information
     - Click "Generate a new IBAN" to quickly switch to the generator
3. UUID Generator section:
   - Select the UUID version (v4 random or v1 time-based)
   - Click the "Generate UUID" button
   - Click the clipboard icon to copy the UUID
4. JSON Formatter section:

   - Click "Convert" to transform the date
   - Use the "Quick inputs" buttons for common dates (Now, Tomorrow, etc.)
   - Click the clipboard icon to copy the converted date
6. Dark Mode:
   - Click the moon/sun icon in the top-right corner to toggle dark mode

## Technical Details

- The IBAN generation follows the standard structure for each country
- IBAN validation checks the country format, length, character validity, and performs ISO 7064 MOD 97-10 checksum verification
- Check digits are calculated according to the ISO 7064 MOD 97-10 algorithm
- UUID v4 generation uses the standard random approach with RFC 4122 compliance
- UUID v1 is time-based with the timestamp from the current time
- JSON formatter validates and formats with custom indentation and syntax highlighting
- Date converter uses the date-fns library for parsing and formatting dates in various formats
- No server-side processing is required; everything runs in the browser

## Disclaimer

The IBANs generated by this tool are random and not connected to any real bank accounts. The UUIDs are for general use but should be tested for collisions in critical applications. This tool is for demonstration purposes only.
